# Appointment-Schedular-Bot
Developed an appointment scheduler chat-bot to aid interactive and user-engaging appointment scheduling of patients in a hospital. The bot is based on Microsoft Bot Framework and takes text or voice as input. To train our data-set for the available functionality, we used Microsoft Azure's cognitive service, Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS). The chat-bot can easily be integrated with different channels such as Facebook messenger, Skype, Web applications.  

The bot is developed for hospital receptionists to efficiently schedule patients' appointments by considering patients' preferences of getting appointment on a particular day/time or with a particular doctor.  A receptionist can perform following functions:

1) Register a patient in a hospital.
2) Schedule patients' appointment based on his/her preferences of day/time and doctor.
3) Reschedule or cancel patients' appointment.
4) Inform patients' about their appointment details

The bot is preferred over traditional form based applications because it's user-engaging and almost typing-free in case of using voice services.
